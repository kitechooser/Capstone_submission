This code is known working with Python 3.10. This was used so the Apple GPU could be utilised.

There is a notebook in ./src that shows aspects of this code running with output
There is example output in ./best_models and ./best_models_meso_128x128_run

The data files needed are in the image_data folder. If you prefer to download them they can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/code/alnomanabdullah/mesonet-with-real-and-fake-images-dataset-1/input

The file 'Model card and datasheet.pdf' holds the datasheet and model card information

NB. although the code runs from the notebook, it is better to run it from the command line with main.py
